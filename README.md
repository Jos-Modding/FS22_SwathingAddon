# FS22 Swathing Addon

The Swathing Addon brings the swathing features first released on Edgewater Saskatchewan to any map. The swathable fruit types are Wheat, Barley, Oats and Canola.

It will work with any mower to cut crops and create swaths. However mods released with the Swathing Icon are designed to work exclusively with swathing and eliminate those pecky grass swaths sneaking into your fields.

After mowing be sure to use the pickup header to harvest your swaths and enjoy the 20% yield bonus from swathing.

Things to note:
- The basegame hired worker will not be able to swath or harvest swaths for you. However Courseplay is a great option that can do both jobs if you reuse your swathing course to harvest.
- May conflict with other crop adjusting mod

Special thanks to Bcbuhler Farms for reaching out to me with the idea for this mod.
